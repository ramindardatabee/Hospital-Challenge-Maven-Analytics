Hospital+patients analaysis - Power BI
Introduction:
This project is based on the June 2024 Maven Analytics data challenge. The goal was to build a high-level KPI report for the executive team using a subset of patient records. The report aims to provide stakeholders with visibility into the hospital’s recent performance and answer the following key questions:
1.	How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
2.	How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average?
3.	How much is the average cost per visit?
4.	How many procedures are covered by insurance?
   
The dashboard should scale to accommodate new data over time, but the CEO has asked you to summarize any insights you can derive from the sample provided.
## About The Data
Synthetic data on approximately 1,000 patients of Massachusetts General Hospital from 2011–2022, including information on patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters & procedures. The dataset is structured across five CSV files.
## Skills
- Power Bi, Power Query
- Data Modelling, Data Visualization 
## Key Findings: 
- 	High readmission and death rates among older patients (75+).
-  Rising claim costs over time, indicating increased healthcare expenditures.
- Inpatient and urgent care visits are the most expensive encounter types.
- 	Telemedicine and outpatient services show cost-efficiency and high insurance coverage.
- 	Certain procedures drive significant costs and resource utilization
## Recommendations
- 	Strengthen partnerships with top insurance providers to negotiate better coverage terms. 
- Promote outpatient and ambulatory care for non-critical cases to reduce costs.
- Review high-cost procedures for optimization opportunities.
-	Expand telemedicine and virtual care models to reduce costs and improve access.
## Conclusion 
The dashboard provides a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making at Massachusetts General Hospital. By leveraging insights into patient demographics, financial trends, and procedural efficiency, the hospital can enhance care delivery, manage costs, and improve patient outcomes. Future iterations of the dashboard can incorporate real-time data and predictive analytics to further support strategic planning.
